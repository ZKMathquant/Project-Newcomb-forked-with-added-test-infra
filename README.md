# Project-Newcomb

Proof-of-concept infrabayesian reinforcement learning (IBRL) agent that converges to optimal policies on Newcomb-like problems and other decision-theoretically complex environments. SPAR Spring 2026 project.

Full design spec: [Architecture Planning Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WkUK5Mc_OsfeaE6wUbuEhdzCXzDbq6pAapHp1LOLCMk)

## Setup

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then:

    git clone https://github.com/Lorxus/Project-Newcomb.git
    cd Project-Newcomb
    uv sync

To add a dependency: `uv add <package-name>`. This updates `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. Commit both.

## Structure

    ibrl/
        agents/          — agent implementations (subclass base)
        environments/    — environment implementations (subclass base)
        simulators/      — simulate(agent, env, **kwargs) -> results
        analysis/        — metrics, plotting, comparison tools

    experiments/
        example/         — working intro simulation
        <your-name>/     — your personal experiment space

**ibrl/** is the shared library. Every change requires a reviewed PR with at least one approval (approve or request changes, not just comments).

**experiments/** is the exploration zone. Create a folder with your git handle. Each experiment gets its own subfolder with a README covering: what and why, design decisions, chat logs if vibe coded, results and interpretation, ideas for shared architecture evolution. PRs here get lighter review.

## Imports

`uv sync` installs `ibrl/` as a local package. From any script or notebook in `experiments/`, import normally:

```python
# sample — these modules don't exist yet
from ibrl.agents.base import BaseAgent
from ibrl.environments.newcomb import NewcombEnv
from ibrl.simulators.basic import simulate
```

If something useful lives in someone else's experiment, promote it to `ibrl/` through a reviewed PR. Experiments should never import from other experiments.

## Workflow

    git checkout -b yourname/short-description
    # make changes
    git push origin yourname/short-description

Then go to the repo on GitHub. You'll see a banner to create a pull request from your branch. Click it, set the base branch to `main`, fill out the PR template (it loads automatically) and request a review. Once approved, squash merge.

All PRs squash merge into main. Squash merging collapses all commits from a branch into a single commit on main, so the history stays clean regardless of how messy your branch was while iterating. Keep branches short-lived.

## Commit messages

Start with the area:

    environments: add parfit hitchhiker
    agents: implement thompson sampling
    experiments: newcomb sweep with varying predictor accuracy
    infra: add smoke test CI

Use infra: for non-code changes like README, CI, pyproject.toml and repo config.

## Rules

- Every new agent subclasses `ibrl.agents.base`
- Every new environment subclasses `ibrl.environments.base`
- Pin a seed for every experiment
- Save your config alongside your results
- If you vibe code, review the output for correctness and adherence to spec
- Don't commit large data files (results/ is gitignored)
